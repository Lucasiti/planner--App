# planner--App
The objective is to create a work day planner to organise tasks throughout the day.

The day is split into hourly segments of the standard working day where tasks can be saved.

Each hourly block is colour coded depending on the time. Grey for hours in the past, red for the current hour and green for the future.

The user can enter a task when they click a timeblock.

Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

Persist events between refreshes of a page.
